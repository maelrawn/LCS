/PROJECT GOALS:

Real-time TUI
Navigable menus:
   
   - team select
      - save/load
   - display stats
   - edit players
   - quit

Have to ask professor if we are allowed to use external packages,
I would like to use ncurses to do this but I can use unicode chars
to simulate flashing menu options otherwise. Probably can simulate
real time graphics by printing a screen of text at a time? Problem
becomes not printing one line at a time without the ability to blit,
but I could probably just create one gigantic 80x24 monster string 
and print the entire thing at once? Alternatively, find some way to 
pause the terminal refresh until printing is done (wow I just
am describing ncurses or analogues).

Professor said I can use ncurses. Project screen mockup:
